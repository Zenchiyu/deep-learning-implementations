<summary>Noise Conditional Score Network using an MLP on my toy distributions</summary>

I've reimplemented a Noise Conditional Score Network (NSCN) based on the "Generative Modeling by Estimating Gradients of the Data Distribution" paper by
Yang Song and Stefano Ermon. My NSCN is a $3$-layer MLP with softplus activation functions since the authors also used a similar architecture on their toy examples.
